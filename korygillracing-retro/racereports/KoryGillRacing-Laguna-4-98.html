<h2>Kory Gill Racing<br>
250GP Race Report<br>
AMA National, Laguna Seca Raceway<br>
April 16<sup>th</sup> &#150; 19<sup>th</sup>, 1998</h2>

<h3>Summary:</h3>

<p>This event was my second race of 1998, my first time to Laguna Seca, and my second AMA
National race. Laguna Seca is an 11 turn, 2.238-mile road course. About 60 bikes were
present for qualifying, 44 bikes made the final grid (a full grid). Out of 11 rows of 4
bikes each, I started the 17-lap main event in row 8C. I completed 16 laps finishing in 23<sup>rd</sup>
place. There was 1 restart as my pit mate and friend Bruce Lind went down in the corkscrew
on the first lap of the first start; unfortunately, he broke some bones in his foot.&nbsp;
He will be out for a while...bummer!&nbsp; Two other bikes also went down before/at the
corkscrew on the first lap too, I &quot;think&quot; it was Renfrow and Sorenson.
&nbsp; This caused a red flag and a restart.&nbsp; At the end of the race, 38 bikes
crossed the finish line.&nbsp; Only the top 30 get any points, they are listed below.</p>

<p><b>Day 1 &#150; April 16, 1998 &#150; Promoter&#146;s Practice</b></p>

<p>9:20am - Goal: To learn the track, watch how others go around the track, work on tuning
the bike.</p>

<p>This was a 20-minute session. I typically use about 1/2 gallon in 15-20 minutes, so I
went out with 1 gallon.&nbsp; That is exactly the right amount to run out of gas on the
next to last lap!&nbsp; Those hills and fast corners kill you gas mileage, even when you
are dog slow like I was out there.&nbsp; I sputtered up the back section and manage to
coast down the corkscrew and into the pits.&nbsp; I checked the bike out, and no harm was
done.&nbsp; I have been to Laguna a few times before to spectate, but never on the track.
&nbsp; Very intimidating at first.&nbsp; I don't have lap times, but I put them in the
1:50+ range!</p>

<p>1:20pm &#150; Goal: Go FASTER.</p>

<p>This was a 60-minute session.&nbsp; I had some time to think about the track, and where
I could go faster.&nbsp; I had yet to find a reference point for turn 1 which is a crest
at the top of the straightaway that kinks left a bit after the top.&nbsp; I finally
figured out how to use some telephone poles...worked very cool as in traffic, you could
still see them.&nbsp; So now, instead of letting off at the crest and having to
&quot;coast&quot; into turn 2, I could let off at the crest and be full on the gas to this
&quot;rubber spot&quot; in the pavement.&nbsp; Braking into turn 2 would be very
important.&nbsp; It is downhill and requires 4 back shifts.&nbsp; I was out there for a
full 50 minutes learning all I could.&nbsp; My jetting was 1 jet too rich, so from now on,
I had/knew a &quot;perfect&quot; setup upon which to make all future &quot;relative&quot;
changes.</p>
<b>

<p>Day 2 &#150; April 17, 1998 &#150; AMA Practice</p>
</b>

<p>9:20am &#150; Goal: Improve on yesterday.</p>

<p>This was a 20-minute session.&nbsp; I went up 2 nozzle sizes to get more gas in the
mid-range since this track has some &quot;longer&quot; mid-throttle sections. &nbsp;
Typically on a 250GP, you are either full on the gas, or not on at all; not at
Laguna.&nbsp; I got 10 laps and had lap times in the 1:42 to 1:41 range.&nbsp; I was
consistent (as usual), but a but off the pace I thought it would take to qualify.&nbsp; I
went out with 2 gallons and used 1.&nbsp; My clutch basket had 1 of 6 rivets broken when I
came to Laguna, upon inspection, 1 more had broken off.&nbsp; In the process, it ground on
my case cover a bit.&nbsp; At this point, I was concerned, but not worried.</p>

<p>1:55pm &#150; Goal: Faster through turns 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10.</p>

<p>This was another 20-minute session.&nbsp; My goal might seem pretty hefty, but Laguna
is a track where everything &quot;flows&quot;.&nbsp; To go fast in turn 3, you must be
fast in turn 2, etc.&nbsp; I needed to pick up the pace everywhere.&nbsp; I felt faster
out there, but I think I was just smoother.&nbsp; I was still turning 1:42 lap times.
&nbsp; My best was a 1:41.94.&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; I was at a &quot;plateau&quot;. &nbsp;
Tomorrow was qualifying.&nbsp; I had to figure out where I was slow and how to go
faster.&nbsp; I went out with 2 gallons, but used 1.5 gallons...a bit more fuel than in
the morning.&nbsp; Upon inspection of the bike, there were more metal fragments in the
lower fairing!&nbsp; Pull the clutch off, and sure enough, 2 more rivets had broken off.
&nbsp; It was now unusable, and the case while not broken, probably would not handle much
more abuse.&nbsp; Well, off to look for a spare to beg, buy, borrow, or steal (well, not
steal).&nbsp; Gary Georges from Wilson's Motorcycle had a spare, but it had one rivet that
was loose.&nbsp; If I used it, it would probably break, but it might be possible to fix
it.&nbsp; This was lead #1.&nbsp; Jim Sidell (sp?) from World Sports had a spare basket
and rivets at home, but his wife who could have brought them down, already left. &nbsp;
Darn!&nbsp; The Ulrich's who have like 3 extra motors would not part out their motors...in
a way, I understand, but in a way, I don't.&nbsp; Keep looking!&nbsp; Finally, I ran
across Andrew Edwards.&nbsp; He had a spare to loan me!&nbsp; Andrew is a really nice
guy.&nbsp; He dared me to try to break his spare...if I did, it was fix or replace with
new at his choosing.&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; I was back in business!&nbsp; Oh yeah, Gary
Georges had a spare side cover, so I decided to replace mine and bought one of his spares.
&nbsp; Andrew and Gary are way cool!</p>
<b>

<p>Day 3 &#150; April 18, 1998 &#150; AMA Practice and Qualifying</p>
</b>

<p>8:30am &#150; Goal: Try something different and see how/if it works.</p>

<p>If you don't try something different, you will never know if it is better or worse!
&nbsp; I dropped my gearing from 14/40 to 14/39.&nbsp; I figured this would be good for
some faster times since I was &quot;trained&quot; to go into turns at X rpms, which now
would be a bit faster (at the same rpm) because of the new gearing.&nbsp; Well, kind of.
&nbsp; I ran consistent 1:41 lap times.&nbsp; A bit better than before, but not much.
&nbsp; The only plus side of this was that this was the first practice of the day for me,
and &quot;you always run a bit slower in the morning&quot;.&nbsp; I had put a new front on
for this practice to break it in.&nbsp; I had also put in new pistons and rings.</p>

<p>2:00pm &#150; Qualifying Heat #1 (my group) &#150; 5 laps.</p>

<p>Goal: Make the main event.</p>

<p>Due to my getting &quot;points&quot; in Phoenix, I was automatically gridded ahead of
anyone without points.&nbsp; I was in the fourth row for my qualifier.&nbsp; The top 22
would go to the main event.&nbsp; The other 8 would go home.&nbsp; (the same would be true
for the #2 qualifier as well).&nbsp; I had a new rear tire on which I broke in on the
warm-up lap.&nbsp; (gotta love slicks)&nbsp; This was my first race start at Laguna...the
unknown await over the crest of turn 1 as we all pile into turn 2.&nbsp; I got a decent
start, but got passed by about 4 people as I tried to find a line through the corner.
&nbsp; I tried my hardest to stay with and pass whoever was in front of me.&nbsp; We got
red-flagged as someone pitched it in turn 4 (cold new tires) in a high side.&nbsp; I got a
better start on the second start, and basically held my position in the event.&nbsp; I
finished 15<sup>th</sup> I think...good enough for the main event!&nbsp; I would be in row
8C.&nbsp; I beat Andrew Edwards, and as it turns out, he was 2 spots from making the main.
&nbsp; Remember, he loaned me a clutch basket.&nbsp; We joked a bit about how if I didn't
have a clutch and wasn't in the qualifier, he might have made the main.&nbsp; At least he
didn't take his clutch back!&nbsp; Since he had a long drive back to Idaho, he let me keep
the clutch and just mail it back to him after the race.&nbsp; I told you he was a cool
guy!</p>
<b>

<p>Day 4 &#150; April 19, 1998 &#150; AMA Practice and Main Event</p>
</b>

<p>9:15am &#150; Goal: take it easy, check the bike out. </p>

<p>I went out and ran some 1:42 laps to get the cob webs out of my head and double check
how the bike was running.&nbsp; The main thing was to get a good plug chop right before
the corkscrew to check jetting.&nbsp; Upon inspection, I was getting some detonation on
the top cylinder.&nbsp; I checked the deck height, and somehow, where I had zero before, I
now had slightly plus numbers.&nbsp; With my high compression heads, I have to be at zero
or less!&nbsp; Well, I had nothing to do till 3pm, so I put in thicker base gaskets.
&nbsp; To be safe, I backed my timing from 1.6/1.6 to 1.5/1.5 (stock).&nbsp; First you
finish, then you finish first.</p>

<p>3pm &#150; 250GP Main Event &#150; 17 Laps </p>

<p>.This was it!&nbsp; I was in the main event at an AMA National race at Laguna Seca!
&nbsp; The air was getting thinner, so I went down 2 more jet sizes from the morning
(which was 2 down from the previous day).&nbsp; Hey, &quot;feed the motor what it
wants&quot; as Bruce Lind says.&nbsp; The sidecars which ran in the morning (I was a
passenger on one all weekend, but that's another story) left oil (well one did, not all)
on the line from turn 2 to turn 11.&nbsp; There were two races before mine, so the track
was in pretty good shape.&nbsp; You could still see the grease sweep all over the track,
but it was not a super big deal.&nbsp; Starting from row 8, turn 2 was wild (as usual).
&nbsp; 44 guys all trying to get the best position possible.&nbsp; I settled in about 30<sup>th</sup>
I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on it hard up the hill to 6, and gassing it hard to the top of
the hill where the corkscrew is.&nbsp; By the time I got to the corkscrew, yellow flags
were waving.&nbsp; I think it was Renfrow and Sorenson (don't quote me on that) that
tangled at the top before the turn.&nbsp; When I got there and popped over, I saw Bruce
Lind's bike sliding the rear as it high-sided him off.&nbsp; I watched him tumble as his
bike spun, flipped, and then whacked a hay bale (all in about .half a second).&nbsp; I was
bummed that it was Bruce that crashed...I think it is harder the better you know someone,
but I feel bad anytime any racer crashes.&nbsp; Well that lasted about 1 microsecond, then
it was back to my own race!&nbsp; At turn 11, the red flags were out.</p>

<p>Well, just like BOTH qualifiers, there was a red flag and a restart.&nbsp; To me, that
was one more Laguna start under my belt!&nbsp; On the restart, I got a better start and
held (defended is more like it) my line over the crest and into turn 2.&nbsp; By turn 4,
we were pretty well sorted out.&nbsp; Well, it looked like we were going to have a
race!&nbsp; I was in about 28<sup>th</sup> place in the back of a group of 4 bikes. &nbsp;
The race was 17 laps, so I sat back and watched for mistakes these guys would make. &nbsp;
I got by one guy under braking, then he got me back later.&nbsp; I later set him up in
turn 11 and powered by him big time over the crest and did some wild late braking into
turn 2.&nbsp; I ended up getting passed back again when I missed a shift.&nbsp; Both the
guys in front of me were dropping anchor in turns 5, 6, and the corkscrew.&nbsp; I knew if
I could get them, I could lose them.&nbsp; The next lap, I set up one guy into turn 5, and
powered extra hard with the rear wheel sliding up the hill to turn 6.&nbsp; I out-braked
the next guy enough to be right on his tail.&nbsp; I was on it hard again and got setup
good for the corkscrew knowing he would drop anchor.&nbsp; My plan was coming together.
&nbsp; I got better drive down the corkscrew and carried that through turn 9 and came out
ahead by turn 11.&nbsp; There was no traffic in front of me and I kept on the gas like all
43 riders were on my tail.&nbsp; This was about the time the halfway flags came out.
&nbsp; My right hand was going numb, and my left leg was getting tired (probably from the
side cars and this race/battle)&nbsp; There was one rider a ways in front of me, and for
the rest of the race, I tried to reel him in.&nbsp; By the end, I was closer, but I never
did get him.&nbsp; It was kind of nice running the last half by myself as I did not have
to worry about getting taken out.&nbsp; About this time though, the leaders started coming
by.&nbsp; First Sands and Foster between turns 3 and 4, then a lap later Roberts.and
Mori.up the hill into 6.&nbsp; I stayed on the gas and tried to hold my line (and be
predictable), but they were in just the spot that I missed my brake marker.&nbsp; I was in
way late, way fast, and blew my downshift before turn 6.&nbsp; I made it through, but
Bobby Keith got caught behind me.&nbsp; I knew by the way he shook his hand at me, that he
was running right with these guys...now he was 2 bike lengths back.&nbsp; I felt bad for
holding up leaders, but there was nothing I could do.&nbsp; As the race went on, I got
more tired, and picked off by leaders here and there.&nbsp; I was tiring and knew my brain
and concentration were about gone and compensated in my riding.&nbsp; Finally the white
flag came out, and I spend what little energy I had to make it one more lap without
crashing, holding a tight line in case any leaders were coming by, and made the checkered
flag.&nbsp; I was very happy!&nbsp; I qualified and finished at Laguna!&nbsp; Having no
idea where I finished, I was stunned at first to learn I got 23<sup>rd</sup> place, but
after it sank in, I am sure I had a glowing smile on my face...it sure felt like it.
&nbsp; I set a new personal best lap time of 1:37.83.&nbsp; I can't wait for next year
there!</p>
