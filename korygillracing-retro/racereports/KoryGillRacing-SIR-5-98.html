May 31 1998</h2>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: </p>

Formula II &#150; <strong>1st Place</strong> <br>

<p><strong>Inside my head: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Formula II: </strong></p>

<p>Formula II mixes the 600cc 4-stroke bikes and the 250cc 2-stroke bikes together. The
600&#146;s have more power, but the 250&#146;s have more cornering speed and can stop/slow
quicker. Today, the latter proved to be the advantage to have! The light goes green, the
race is on. I get a good launch off the line and going into turn 1 (T1) about 5 600&#146;s
are in front of me. This time, I made note of who exactly was in front of me. I settle in
behind and started planning how to pick them off. Ferraza on a 250 was riding well, and
passed me in T3, but I got him back later. He eventually crashed while behind me. I really
can&#146;t remember when exactly I got who, but I remember railing around someone on the
outside to T2, another between T3 and T4, a really good pass around T9 which leads into
the &#147;bus stop&#148; or T10. About the halfway point of this 10 lap race, just
Perreault and Gooch were in front of me. These guys are pretty fast. Coming into T3, I get
right on Perreault&#146;s rear end. I am setting him up for T4. He goes wide, I go to the
inside and gas it early. We are neck and neck down the entire back straight to T5. His 600
and my 250! (after the race was over, both of us were surprised!) I *think* this is where
I got him&#133;by making my pass stick into T5. Now I am really focussed on getting Gooch.
I put my head down and charge. I really can&#146;t remember many details from here, but I
did pass him on lap 8 since I know I was leading on lap 9. Wow, I am in 1st on the last
lap! Make it stick&#133;ride smart&#133;finish the race. I kept him at bay and took the
checker! My first 1st place! </p>

<p>I came into the pits simply beaming with joy! What a race. What a battle. I really must
thank my competitors for riding a good race. Everyone had great predicatble lines, rode
smoothly&#133;to me, this means a good, honest, &#147;safe&#148; race! Janet was timing me
and got me at 1:31.3! Bruce Lind came over and said he got me at 1:31.6 on one lap as
well! I think Mike Sullivan who wins many races at SIR turns 1:30 and 1:29 times&#133;the
track record might be in the 1:27 range, but don&#146;t quote me on that. I was really
flying! </p>

<p><strong>250GP: </strong></p>

<p>This class, as the name implies, is just 250cc 2-stroke bikes. A race where the bikes
are &#147;even&#148;, and rider skill plays a more important role. Well, tuning can play a
large role too&#133; I was jetted perfect (or 1 jet from perfect). I got a great start and
led into T1. Craig Harry had a mechanical and didn&#146;t get out today, so the only other
logical (main) competitor today would be Ferazza. I charged hard as if I was leaving off
from where my previous race left off! After a few laps, as I was coming out of T4, I could
see a bike coming down the hill into T3; it was Joe Ferazza! Whoa! I had pulled about a 4
second lead. I had more speed down the straight, and Joe wasn&#146;t catching me in the
corner. 3rd place was back quite a ways from what I was told. I pulled a few good wheelies
coming out of T10 where you have to shift down to first. A couple were decent, but on one,
I really got the front end up there and actually grabbed 2nd gear (which normally sets the
front wheel back on the ground), but instead of the wheel dropping, it stayed up. I was
having fun, so I rode it till I had to turn onto the straight. I guess the crowd liked it.
I took the white flag and just hoped the gremlins wouldn&#146;t attack my bike on the last
lap. They didn&#146;t, and I took the checker leading the race from start to finish! I
would have liked to have more of a battle with my competitors, but having a clear track
for 10 laps was sure fun. My times were in the 1:32 range. Faster than my previous best,
but not as fast as my best of the day. </p>

<p>What a day! Sunshine, 70+ degree temperatures, <strong>2 First place finishes</strong>.
</p>

<p>I have to thank Janet for timing me, feeding me lunch, and keeping me full of fluids.
Also, no race day would be complete without sharing it with all the friends who showed
up&#133;thanks!</p>
