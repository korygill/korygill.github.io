250GP and Formula II Race Report<br>
July 12 1998</h2>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>: </p>

<p>250GP &#150; <strong>1st Place</strong> <br>
Formula II &#150; <strong>1st Place</strong> <br>
Got close to best time of 1:31.3 doing consistant 1:31.5's and 1:31.6's</p>

<p><strong>Formula II: </strong></p>

<p>Got a good start and was running 3rd going into T1 and 4th into T2 behind the 600 Super
Bikes. Got past one bike into T3/T4. When we got to T6, yellow flags were waving...there
was a crash in T7 too, both from the wave of bikes starting in front of us. The race was
red flagged. We were told to go to grid for a restart...the only problem was the track was
not ready. So here we have a bunch of bikes getting really hot waiting on the grid. My
bike got to 75C just idling; it should be 65C at wide open. I think this caused my plugs
to foul since during the race it sputtered ever so slightly, and after the race they were
wet despite getting a good plug chop. We finally get a green track and the wave in front
of us takes off. I get the bike in gear. The red light goes out, I get a great start and
am 1st going into T1! I make it stick and by T3, I am already into back markers from the
wave in front. (they let us go a little too quickly, but bikes were overheating). The
track was weird. You would have full traction, then all of a sudden without doing
anything, the tires would slide. I can see why we had so many crashes, but how to avoid
these slides was tough. I was coming around T9 like normal, and the rear just let go. It
slid out, I stayed on the gas and stood the bike up and recovered. We get in 2 full laps
before another red flag comes out again to end the race. We were past the halfway point
(the leaders were), so it was called a race. Perrault crashed in Formula 600, the race
before this one, and never made it to this race. If my calculations are correct, I am
leading the class by 2 points now in Formula II! </p>

<p><strong>250GP: </strong></p>

<p>We need more bikes in this class. The 250GP bike is the best-handling, funnest bike I
have ever ridden. I get a good start and lead going into T1. I led from start to finish
running consistent 1:31.5 and 1:31.6 lap times. Ferazza finished 2nd with me gaining about
.8 seconds a lap on him in this 8-lap race. In some senses it is boring racing by myself
(we just need more bikes!), but pushing myself, pushing the bike's limits, and learning is
fun too. On the 2nd lap, I came in a little hot into T10 (the bus stop) and when I threw
the bike in, both tires slid. I didn't let it spook me and gassed it like normal and
looked at the exit where I wanted to go. It worked, and I just barely ran over a cone
marking the edge of the pavement. It wasn't as bad (in my mind) as it looked to the
crowd...this is based on a few people's comments that it was the best 2-wheel drift they'd
seen in a while. Like I said above, the track would seem fine, then just kind of let go. I
think maybe it rained enough the previous day or so to bring up selected oil spots, but
not enough to wash anything off the track surface. I gained another 8 points on Ferazza
who is leading the points. I am not sure if I can catch him points-wise, but having fun is
what I care about most. </p>

<p><strong>End of day tuning info: </strong></p>

<p>I don't believe in having tuning &quot;secrets&quot; so I am adding my tuning notes to
my reports. Maybe this will help someone, maybe it won't. Granted, different bikes run
differently, but here is what worked for my 93 TZ250. </p>
