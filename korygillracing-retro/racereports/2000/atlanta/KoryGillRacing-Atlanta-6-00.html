<p>Executive Summary:<br>

A pictoral storyboard of the weekend follows.</p>

<h3>Friday - Practice and learn track (first time at Road Atlanta)</h3>

<p>Arrive Friday morning to find the pits all setup by Ed Sorbo (what a guy!)</p>

<p><img border="0" src="thepits.jpg" width="319" height="151"></p>

<p>The first session, I go out and do fairly consistent 1:43's.&nbsp; I have a
good idea of where the track goes afterwards, but need a lot of help setting
entry speed and finding reference points.&nbsp; I talk with Ed Sorbo and Bruce
Lind and gather a plan of attack for the afternoon session.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="LE-and-ed.jpg" width="240" height="203"></p>

<p>I go out in the second session and get down to 1:39's.&nbsp; I am happy with
that.&nbsp; I know a few places where I can go faster, but I just have to figure
out how to accomplish it.&nbsp; I consult with Ed and his tuner Bill and will
try some things in Saturday's practice session.</p>

<h3>Saturday - Practice and Qualifying</h3>

<p>Having thought a lot about the track and trying to piece together ways to
lower my lap times, I was ready for Saturday.&nbsp; I knew the track and had
figured out how to &quot;connect&quot; most of the corners and had some
reference points down.&nbsp; I was hoping to drop another 2 seconds and get down
to 1:37's.&nbsp; I went out in practice and only did 39's and 40's.&nbsp; I
believe I was faster in a few places like T10 and T12, but for some reason I was
giving up time in T2 and T5.&nbsp; I could still go faster in T7, but I was
having a hard time setting my turn-in point to avoid the concrete patch on the
outside of the &quot;good inside line&quot;.&nbsp; The bike was jetted perfectly
and was making great power.</p>

<p>I would do the best I could for Qualifying.&nbsp; I was gridded on Row
4D.&nbsp; The temperature was 99F with 35% humidity.&nbsp; I got a decent start,
but let the immediate group in front of me get away and finished the 5 lap heat
race 15th which put me on row 8A for the Main.&nbsp; I did however advance 2
rows on the start to pass and beat Andy Edwards (friend and arch enemy :).</p>

<p>Here's a picture of Bruce Lind delivering the final grid for the main event:</p>

<p>I decided to change my pistons since they were approaching the 300-mile
limit.&nbsp; I noticed some detonation on the top cylinder so threw that piston
away, but kept the other for a spare.&nbsp; I had the bike back together after
an hour or so and put 2 heat-cycles on it to break-in the new pistons.</p>

<p>While I was working, the 750s were out and Jake Holden, a Seattle area rider,
crashed and busted his foot up.</p>

<p>The Ricci team would not be fixing his bike this weekend, but they kept
working on Jimmy Moore's bike to get the max horsepower they could.</p>

<h3>Sunday - Practice and Main Event</h3>

<p>The forecast was for 40% chance of scattered showers.&nbsp; There was a crash
in practice on lap 2, so we had a delay and only got about 4 laps for the
remainder of the session, but that was enough to scrub in the new tires.</p>

<p>The bike was all ready for the main event at 2pm, so I just sat around the
pits.&nbsp; Here's a pic of me with the bike all prepared for the Main.</p>

<p><b>The Main Event:</b></p>

<p>Well, it was time to get ready for the Main Event.&nbsp; The bike was ready,
and so was I.&nbsp; The weather was not 100% predictable, but I figured I would
run slicks and deal with any moisture we would get.&nbsp; Since the weather was
&quot;good&quot;, they moved our race to right after Pro Thunder
qualifying.&nbsp; Right as soon as we lined up for the warm-up lap, it started
to sprinkle.&nbsp; The AMA declared it a &quot;wet race&quot; and gave us 2
warm-up laps.&nbsp; Turns 1 to 5 were dry, and turns 6 to about 11 were wet with
a light drizzle.&nbsp; No problem I though, it would be a short shower and the
track would be &quot;drying&quot; throughout the race.&nbsp; I get a great start
and pass a couple of rows by turn 1 and am right in the 20+ pack of riders as we
head single file through turns 2-5.&nbsp; We get to turn 6 and I see a rider
lowside.&nbsp; France had just passed me and we both decided to go outside and
take a straight line in the grass to avoid the mess.&nbsp; As we slow and turn
for T7, I see pit-mate Bruce Lind's bike in the middle of the track exiting T7
and there's Bruce &quot;protected&quot; behind his bike with his arm up waving
to everyone (as in don't hit me).&nbsp; I pass the incident without noticing too
much else and gas it.&nbsp; France raises his hand as if he was assuming a red
flag would be shown.&nbsp; (personally I think this is a mistake)&nbsp; He was
off the racing line, but I gas it and assume the mess will be cleaned up by the
time we are back there in another 1:30+ seconds...&nbsp; By T10 a red flag is
out.</p>

<p>I stop in the pits and tell Edie that Bruce fell and he appeared okay since I
saw his eyes open and he was waving.&nbsp; It turns out that he gave it too much
gas and the bike slid, caught, and spit him off.&nbsp; As he was tumbling to a
stop Randy Renfrow ran over him; Randy *was* trying his hardest to brake and
avoid Bruce!&nbsp; Later, we would learn that Bruce had a broken leg.&nbsp; It
turns out that 5-7 bikes crashed in this ordeal.</p>

<p>The race was restarted after a short delay, in now totally dry
conditions.&nbsp; We got one warm-up lap and I returned to my 8A grid
position.&nbsp; The light turns green and I get another great start and am going
into turn 1 with the pack.&nbsp; As I round T5 and head up the short hill, my
clutch starts to slip.&nbsp; Crap!&nbsp; I take it easy on the bike and return
to the pits.&nbsp; I stop by the Suzuki pits and yell out &quot;get me 10mm
wrench and a screwdriver&quot;.&nbsp; I take some adjustment out of the clutch
and try to rejoin the race.&nbsp; At T3 the clutch is slipping again.&nbsp; I
circulate around the track off the racing line and around T7, the leaders pass
me.&nbsp; I signal my intentions to leave the track again and park the bike in
the pits in case there is another red flag which would give me time to install a
new clutch and get more laps.&nbsp; The race runs the remainder without any such
red flags (which is a good thing).&nbsp; After the race I push the bike back to
the pits.&nbsp; Oh well, &quot;that's racing&quot;.</p>

<p>I still had a blast at Atlanta and like the track a lot.&nbsp; I got in some
good laps and had fun.&nbsp; Since Bruce was injured, we left right away as Ed
offered to load our stuff up.&nbsp; After some searching for crutches for Bruce,
we hit the airport on-time and returned home around midnight.&nbsp; I said hello
to my wife Janet and gave her a big kiss and told her how much I missed her and
was off to bed.</p>

<p>Next weekend is Road America in Elkhart Lake, WI...I will *not* have&nbsp; a
clutch failure there! (I hope :)</p>
