<h2>Kory Gill Racing<br>
OMRRA at PIR<br>
October 4, 1998 </h2>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>2nd Place in 250 GP<br>
<br>
<strong>250 GP:<br>
</strong><br>
My last race of 1998 was one of the best &quot;races&quot; of the year, so I'll just cut
to the chase and get to the main event! </p>

<p>Going into the event, Joe was leading the 250GP class by 8 points with myself in 2nd
spot. If I could take 1st place and somehow convince Joe to finish 4th or worse, I would
take the lead and win the overall championship. Well, I beat him in the race, but will
have to &quot;settle&quot; for 2nd overall. Settle? No way! This is my first year getting
a season trophy...I'll take 2nd! Here's how it went... </p>

<p>I get the &quot;Kory Gill patented rocket start&quot; and lead all the way down the
straight and into turn 1 (T1). 5 of the fastest 250's in the area are at the race.
Somewhere behind me is Joe Ferazza, Gene Brown, Bruce Lind, and Scott Menezes; all of whom
I consider great racing buddies! I lead the entire lap and all the way back to T1 when I
shifted poorly and hit a false neutral. I was scared to let out the clutch mid-corner, so
I coasted to the exit of the corner then popped it into gear not knowing if the bike would
lurch, wind up, or something...in doing so, I went from 1st to 3rd! Ack! It was Gene and
Bruce who got by me. Each of them has been racing longer than I have been alive and these
guys know how to get around a track pretty fast. I collect myself and tail Bruce waiting
for ANY chance to get him (safely of course!). I was going into T7 on the outside and here
comes Joe about 10mph faster on the inside passing me...I was really moving, and I have no
idea how Joe made it, but now I was in 4th. We were all racing so close one could almost
touch the next bike...it was fabulous. It must have looked like some orchestrated
synchronized exibition, but trust me, it wasn't...we all wanted bragging rights! I draft
Joe down the straight and pull to the inside and pass on the inside under heavy braking. I
went way late into T1 and had to scrub of a lot of speed before pitching it in. Now I have
my eyes set on Bruce again. If I can pass Bruce then pass Gene, I will take 1st and
hopefully Joe will be stuck in 4th and I will be champ! I could make up all the distance
on Gene and Bruce between T3 and T4 every lap. I draft Bruce coming out of T4 and use
Joe's little T7 move and pass Bruce really hot into T7...thanks Joe! In all honesty, I
would only make an inside pass like that against a racer I trust and who I know trusts me.
Now it's just me and Gene! I tried and tried to catch him for a few laps and just couldn't
close in. I never saw Joe or Bruce again, but assumed they were &quot;right on my
tail&quot;. Turns out Bruce's bike started slipping the clutch so Joe got by him and
that's how we finished. This race may not have been my best &quot;finish&quot;, but it
certainly ranks up there as my best &quot;race&quot;. </p>

<p>Well, it's time to hang up the road racing gear for the winter (and get the dirt riding
gear out). Thanks to I-90 Motorsports, Galfer, Motul, TPowell Photography and Team
WetLeather for a GREAT season. </p>
