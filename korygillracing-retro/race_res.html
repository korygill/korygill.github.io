<h3><a name="Current Standings"></a>2000 PLANS</h3>

<h3>SPONSORSHIP PROPOSAL</h3>

<p>I am seeking sponsorship for the 2000 season in the form of product/equipment
contributions, and/or financial contributions. My racing history shows my ability to be
competitive at multiple tracks for entire seasons. My plans are to compete at WMRRA,
OMRRA, and AMA race day events which means more exposure for my sponsors! My more
successful race weekends have generated media exposure in Road Racing publications as well
as Club-level newsletters which are read by racers and non-racers alike.&nbsp; I
always promote my sponsors and recommend their products because I would not use
them if they were not the best products on the market! </p>

<h4>In return for your sponsorship, I will provide the following promotional components:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Product banner displays and/or service referrals.</li>
  <li>Product literature and/or business card displays.</li>
  <li>Emblem display on race bike, leathers, &amp; transport vehicles.</li>
  <li>Trophy award promotionals.</li>
  <li><em>Road Racing World &amp; Motorcycle Technology</em> media coverage.</li>
  <li>Regular updates and racing results.</li>
  <li>Complete racing season results and product performance feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see from the photo above, I am serious about racing. I present a
professional image, and I have sufficient space in my pit area and transport vehicles for
banners, signs, et cetera. I want to promote racing, my sponsor's products and services,
and have fun doing it. Together we can make it happen!</p>
