        This page has some pictures to give a few ideas of how to mount the <a href="http://www.aimracingproducts.com/"> SpeedTune</a>
        on your motorcycle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two brackets are pictured here.&nbsp; The unused one (right, as you sit on
        the bike) was blocked by the brake reservoir, so I used the right side which
        allows unobstructed view.&nbsp; It does not take much to hold the SpeedTune (2
        zip ties).&nbsp; This also allows easy removal to check/replace the battery.<br>

        Rear view.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        The right bracket uses a simple &quot;S&quot; type bend around the mounting
        point for the power valve controller.&nbsp; A small loop of safety wire holds
        the bracket on the &quot;right&quot; side, and some more wire looped around the
        &quot;left&quot; side helps to &quot;pinch&quot; the whole assembly
        together.&nbsp; A little foam made the speed tune sit nicely and a couple zip
        ties were used to hold the SpeedTune.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        My current bracket (outlined in red) has a few simple bends in it to wrap
        around the CDI.&nbsp; It's held on entirely by duct tape!&nbsp; I'm sure some
        adhesives might work too, but this assembly was used the entire 2000 AMA season
        and is showing no signs of wear.<br>

    <p>
        Installation in the pipe is relatively easy, but should be done by a
        qualified welder.&nbsp; My sensors were originally brazed on the pipe and it did
        not hold.&nbsp; You can see the square &quot;patch&quot; that was welded on the
        pipe and around the threaded fitting the sensor screws into.&nbsp; Have the
        sensor welded professionally.
